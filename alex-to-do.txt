This is Alex's current mental stack (2013 1st Quarter)


Todo:
-----

- if serial is wrong the message is still ok (it should be an error message)
- discriminator lamp installer vs all-in-one
- all-in-one for Linux?
- on installer check support for HTML5 of browser
- remove last selection when render

Todo:
+ (done, review and testing needed) license back
+ add a readme inside zip
+ protect installer too (only steps after step2)
+ save, save as, load and edit diagram
+ manage users
+ gave up to VERSION, WEBADRESS
x rebuild installer
x public view diagram
x on "my diagrams" logout link is broken
x fix my settings
x hide "forgot password"
x images (svg in network package) not loaded
x background of diagrams should be white (not transparent)
x write specific php.ini settings
x plug to dcentral (add version)
x update build script



Later:
SVG background of canvas
#1 - when save canvases with SVG it got errors
	Security error
	[Break On This Error] 	

	var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL();
