Diagramo is HTML5 based diagram editor.

It was basically made so that it can be installed on a server but can run locally
if you download the all-in-one version (see: http://diagramo.com/download.php )

Versions

                 Recommended for local computer deployment. 

    - LAMP installer - This package is an "ALL PLATFORMS" web wizard/installer.
                Unzip it to you folder and point the browser to the deploy URL.
                Recommended for deployments on servers.

This version is the most easy to run. It includes anything you need to run the application locally.
