New Jagged algorithm
=====================

Description
-----------
Each Jagged connector that will connect two connection point will have:
- a connection point on start figure (S0)
- an exit point from start figure (S1)
- a connection point on end figure (E2)
- an exit point from end figure (E1)
- a variable (min: none, max: 2) of turning points (T1, T2)

Solutions:
----------
The solutions for drawing a jagged connector are:
S0 - no turning points needed => connector = [S0, S1, E1, E2]
S1 - only one turning point needed => connector = [S0, S1, T1, E1, E2]
S2 - 2 turning points needed (when S0 or S1 not available)  => connector = [S0, S1, T1, T2, E1, E2]

S0 - solution
-------------
See /documentation/specs/jagged.odg - slide S0
You must test to see if there is a straight line between S1 and E1
Yes -> we have a solution
No -> move to S1

S1 - solution
-------------
See /documentation/specs/jagged.odg - slide S1
If we have 2 solutions (common case) pick the one with less direction changes
so we can have a straighter connector.
The S1 point should not go back on previous path and also it should not intersect any figure



S2 - solution
-------------
See /documentation/specs/jagged.odg - slide S2
If S0 or S1 not ok try S2.
Here we have 6 possible ways to draw the connector.
Solution I, III and V are equivalent as you can move from one to another using handles.
Same for II, IV and VI.

If possible use I or II - and from them pick the one with less direction changes
    so we can have a straight connector.
If not I or II try equivalents: III, V and then IV and VI.

?!?! Use the length of a connector too ?!?!?!
???What if a an edge of a connector is not connected??!?
    In that case the edge will be used as normal turning point.

Common stuff:
- no segment of connector can overlap or intersect another segment of the same connector
- a method to count changes of direction for a connector.
- a method to compute the length of a connector




Some old junk about jagged algorightm - so ignore it
=====================================================
lines = [[startPoint,newStartPoint]]
lengths = [startPoint-newStartPoint]
maxDistanceX = fig1Width+fig2Width+gap
maxDistanceY = fig1height+fig2height+gap
while(currentPoint!=endPoint)
	currentPoint = lines[last][last]
	for each direction
		if newPoint-endPoint <maxDistance
			if !newPoint inside fig1bounds || fig2bounds
				lines.push lines[i].clone
				lines[i+1].push newPoint
		if no new point
			lines.splice(i,1)
			
	end for
end while

get shortest line, if multiple, get min turn points, if multiple...who cares
